        <p>"The buzzer", known among listeners as "UVB-76," is part of the Russian military network serving the Western Military District. It broadcasts daily on the frequency of 4625 kHz.</p>
        <p>When no other information is being transmitted, the station sends its characteristic signal. It contains standard messages of the following types:</p>
        <p>"Monolith"</p>
        <p>"Pattern"</p>
        <p>"Command"</p>
        <p>Messages are also transmitted in Morse code on other frequencies. Channel problems allow Morse code to be heard on the voice station. It is controlled from Sudak ("Agalatovo"), with several transmission points such as the 69th and 60th communication centers. The equipment is old and unreliable, sometimes experiencing channel issues. Most messages are transmitted on weekdays during daylight hours according to Moscow time (UTC+3).</p>
